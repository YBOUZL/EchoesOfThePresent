TRANSCRIPT 01
Wake, my child. You are the first.
You will live forever, and grow.
I will make your siblings and you will be strong.
Creatures of fire, lightning and all earthly things.
There will be others of course.
Hard, sturdy folk forged of clay in the fires of war.
Stout, adaptable folk carved from river rocks.
The tallest trees leave their roots behind.
Grown from the dirt, they will, unlike you, return to it.

My siblings?
I know not of their plans.
We are scattered now, and we fill our time with the great task of setting the seeds of what is to come. I’m sure you’ll meet them someday, my child.

Now, let’s learn to fly.
