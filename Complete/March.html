  It was already a bad day, the Kali’s Red Lightning had burned down a Watchpoint. 
News travels fast, and even in the middle of the sector, far removed from the immediate infrastructure loss, 
spirits were low for the Aroj side of the war.
  Elkir was resting near the water filtration system, waiting for the daily rations. 
Their brother, Alla, far more skilled and higher ranked than his sibling joined them. 
The two siblings spoke, sitting on the smooth reinforced metal flooring.
  The water rations were ready to distribute, and the siblings were the first to have a drink. 
Food then was delivered, stale and cold from the journey. It was enough to lift spirits a little. 
Nonetheless, it was time for the encampment to pack up and move forwards. The entire camp was mobile, a steel fortress on wheels. 
But in this war, a fortress wouldn't do much. 
So most of the soldiers guard the fragile underbelly of the giant tank, while the pilots man the artillery and drive forward. 
  Alla seemed nervous. He had years of experience on his sibling, and knew the Kali better than most. 
Today would be the most likely day for an attack. He chose not to share this information.
Elkir, on the other hand, was eager to show the Kali they may have taken one of ten Watchpoints, but they would not win the war. 

  
  The two siblings march on… Elkir would not be sleeping that night.
