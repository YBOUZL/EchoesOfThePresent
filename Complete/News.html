BREAKING NEWS:
REVOLUTIONARY MATERIAL DISCOVERED IN ASTEROID; P.HIGHLAND SAYS “THIS MAY HAVE JUST CHANGED THE FUTURE OF THE HUMAN RACE!”

Today, Professor Highland was running tests on a strange material found by a routine asteroid-mining operation when she found something spectacular. 
The material was not made of any known elements or molecules, it was a stabilized form of the theoretical substance known as 
“PRIM” which was the substance the universe was originally constructed from!

The crystals have properties that Prim was theorized to have, but are even stranger. 
They glow an unearthly spectrum of colors and possess unnatural durability. Despite their durability, 
an exposure to vibrations of a frequency of 382Hz will destabilize it, causing it to take the form of whatever matter it is touching. 
If more of these crystals are found, it may just change the course of history as we know it.
